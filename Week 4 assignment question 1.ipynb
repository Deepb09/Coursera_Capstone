I used to live in Owings Mills, Maryland with walking distance to the Grand Junction Metro Station with great connectivity to Baltimore Downtown as well as Washington, D.C., all shopping stores, groceries and pharmacy was nearby to my apartment. But since I am moving to Florida I want to use the skills learned during IBM Data Science Specialization course to help me find a suitable apartment that meets the price range along with good locality which should be connected easily to public transport such as metros and buses and have groceries stores and good restaurants nearby. I can use apartment and renting websites to help me with my situation but I want to apply my learning and utilize the tools I used to help solve the problem. To help solve the problem, I will evaluate and compare the apartments available for renting in Miami, Florida and they should meet the following measures:"
